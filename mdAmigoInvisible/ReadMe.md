The aim is to develop a Java application that randomly assigns "secret Santas" among the members of a group. Each person will only have one secret Santa (to whom they will give a gift), and each person can only be the secret Santa of one other person (to whom they will receive a gift). At the end of the process, every person will have a secret Santa assigned, and they will, in turn, be the secret Santa for someone else. Clearly, a person cannot be their own secret Santa.

Also, let's consider a situation in which there are couples within the group of friends. In this case, the problem of assigning secret Santas becomes a bit more complicated, as it is not allowed for an individual to be the secret Santa of their partner.
