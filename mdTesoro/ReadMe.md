## mdTesoro Module ðŸ’°

A treasure map had the following indications:

On the beach of Margarita Island there are three palm trees, one with a yellow mark, one with a blue mark and a
third one with a pink mark. The three palm trees allow you to locate a treasure hidden in the sand. To do so,
the following instructions must be followed:
* From the pink palm tree, move in a straight line to the yellow one, counting the number of steps. Once in
the yellow palm tree, turn 90 degrees counterclockwise and move forward in a straight line
the same number of steps counted before. Drive a stake (we'll call it a yellow stake) into the location
reached.
* Return to the pink palm tree and repeat the procedure walking now towards the blue palm tree but turning
90 degrees clockwise. Also drive a stake (we will call it blue stake)
in the place reached.
* The treasure is located halfway between the yellow and blue stake.

Create a Java program in which we provide six arguments, the first two generate the
position on the coordinate plane of the yellow palm tree, the following two the position of the blue palm tree
and the last two, the pink palm tree. The program must create an object of class Tesoro with
the previous data and show the position in which the treasure is located.
