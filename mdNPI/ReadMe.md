## mdNPI Module ðŸ§®

The aim of this exercise is to create a calculator simulator that operates with Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) (NPI in Spanish). This notation is characterized by not using parentheses to describe arithmetic expressions. Thus, the expression

3 * (6-4) + 5

is written in RPN as follows

3 6 4 - * 5 + 

Reference [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation#:~:text=8%20External%20links-,Explanation,5%20is%20added%20to%20it.) to understand the way of operation of RPN.

Create the NPI class that maintains four variables x, y, z, t with the following behavior:
* Has a default constructor.
* The public void method enters (double value) that simulates the
entry of a value.
* The public void suma() method that simulates the input of a sum.
* The public void subtraction() method that simulates the input of a subtraction.
* The public void multiply() method that simulates the input of a
multiplication.
* The public void divide() method that simulates the input of a
division.
* The public double getResult() method that returns the value of
the variable x.
* Define a representation for the objects of this class of the form NPI(x =â€¦, y = â€¦, z = â€¦, t = â€¦).
