## mdNPI Module ðŸ§®

The aim of this exercise is to create a calculator simulator that operates with Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) (NPI in Spanish). This notation is characterized by not using parentheses to describe arithmetic expressions. Thus, the expression

3 * (6-4) + 5

is written in RPN as follows

3 6 4 - * 5 + 

Reference [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation#:~:text=8%20External%20links-,Explanation,5%20is%20added%20to%20it.) to understand the way of operation of RPN.
